I teach yoga classes to the CWRU Yoga club and greater Cleveland Community and typically read about two books a month. Luckily, my time management is always on par!\nAs a dedicated research scientist with over four years spent understanding brain injury and transnational research, my career is defined by moving scientific discoveries across the research continuum to improve patient outcomes. I am adept at literature reviews to understand gaps in the current literature as well as using biostatistics to model these findings. My work has culminated into my first plenary speaker presentation: “Smarter After the Smack: What My Traumatic Brain Injury Taught Me About Diagnosising Yours” at the Brain Injury Conference of Pennsylvania June of 2025.\nNot only am I an aspiring research scientist, but I am a mentor. In my role as a mentor for the PubMed Healthcare Analytics Program I mentored a cohort of seven undergraduate students ranging from bio-medical engineering students, pre-health students and pre-law students. I aim to continue to ask research questions that have measurable patient outcomes. I am committed to improving the statistical quality of research and believe in the power of interdisciplinary research to solve health challenges.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

SKY Meditation is a unique breath-based technique that uses cyclical, rhythmic patterns of breath to bring the mind and body effortlessly into meditation. This technique is a great way for anyone to deep their toes into meditation. I look forward to expanding my yoga teaching beyond vinyasa style classes to incorporate restorative breathing.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
